# Intro

Team Fortress 2 x Blender is undoubtedly a match made in heaven. With TF2's unique artstyle and Blender's ability to manipulate anything, a good art piece is always at your grasp. If people can get away with what they do on SFM, imagine what can be done in Blender. But hold your horses!! Don't get too carried away with whatever you're thinking- Remember that TF2 content was never meant for Blender. While it may be possible to get the results that you want, there's things worth noting for your new adventure.

Let's compare SFM and Blender.

## SFM
Source Filmmaker is an animation program- that's it. There are no tools for modeling, texturing, sculpting, etc. This isn't a problem because of its workshop feature. Users have access to a wide array of User Generated Content to help them create.

While it is an animation program, it also has an extremely extensive particle system for quick, good-looking effects that requires almost no experience to setup.

Source Filmmaker is simple and caters to the users by having many built-in tools for their needs.
### Pros
- Workshop
  - Thousands of UGC at anyone's disposal
- Streamlined for animation
  - wip
- Good ratio between scene detail and program performance
  - Because SFM runs off of the Source game engine, everything is more realtime due to having model, lighting, and material data pre-baked, saving tremendous amounts of calculations from being performed.
- Realtime motion paths
  - Blender doesn't have that!
- Quick rigging tools for types of armatures (rigs)
  - It's a matter of clicking an item from a menu to rig a character with Inverse Kinematics.
### Cons
- Extremely outdated
  - Uses Python 2.7
  - 32 bit program (limited to ~3.5GB of RAM!)
  - Very prone to crashing and visual issues
  - Limited rendering options
  - Uses 2007 TF2 (better than nothing I suppose)
- Hassle to port
  - Bringing models into SFM can be such a hassle due to:
    - Compiling to .mdl, requiring a prepared .qc file
    - Converting textures to .vtf format
    - Writing materials
    - Requires specific folder structure
  - If they started in Blender, why not keep them there?
- Extremely limiting
  - Making a funny face on the fly is limited to the controls given for such purposes (if there are any!)

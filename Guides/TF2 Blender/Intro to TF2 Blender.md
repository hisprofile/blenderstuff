# Intro

Team Fortress 2 x Blender is undoubtedly a match made in heaven. With TF2's unique artstyle and Blender's ability to manipulate anything, a good art piece is always at your grasp. If people can get away with what they do on SFM, imagine what can be done in Blender. But hold your horses!! Don't get too carried away with whatever you're thinking- Remember that TF2 content was never meant for Blender. While it may be possible to get the results that you want, there's things worth noting for your new adventure.

Let's compare SFM and Blender.

## SFM
Source Filmmaker is an animation program- that's it. There are no tools for modeling, texturing, or sculpting. However, that isn't a problem because of its workshop feature. Users have access to a wide array of User Generated Content to help them create.

While it is an animation program, it also has an extremely extensive particle system for quick, good-looking effects that requires almost no experience to setup.

Source Filmmaker is simple and caters to the users by having many built-in tools for their needs.
### Pros
- Workshop
  - Thousands of UGC at anyone's disposal
- Streamlined for animation
  - wip
- Good ratio between scene detail and program performance
  - Because SFM runs off of the Source game engine, everything is more realtime due to having model, lighting, and material data pre-baked, saving tremendous amounts of calculations from being performed.
- Realtime motion paths
  - Blender doesn't have that!
- Quick rigging tools for types of armatures (rigs)
  - It's a matter of clicking an item from a menu to rig a character with Inverse Kinematics.
- Good for old PCs
### Cons
- Extremely outdated
  - Uses Python 2.7
  - 32 bit program (limited to ~3.5GB of RAM!)
  - Very prone to crashing and visual issues
  - Limited rendering options
  - Uses 2007 TF2 (better than nothing I suppose)
  - Entirely reliant on community to workaround issues (respect+)
- Hassle to port
  - Bringing models into SFM can be such a hassle due to:
    - Compiling to .mdl, requiring a prepared .qc file
    - Converting textures to .vtf format
    - Writing materials
    - Requires specific folder structure
  - If they started in Blender, why not keep them there?
- Extremely limiting
  - Making a custom funny face on demand is impossible
  - Adding single images requires making a mesh plane then porting it to SFM

## SFM for Team Fortress 2
### Pros
- Team Fortress 2 content is native to SFM
  - Everything works and looks how it should. Face posing, character shaders, particles, maps
- Easy to rig with IK
- Good ratio between scene detail and program performance
  - TF2 maps can be extremely detailed. Achieving an accurate result in Blender requires many workarounds and affects performance. Of course, this is no issue for SFM.
- Particles galore
  - The one thing Blender doesn't have...
- Built-In action recorder
  - Records your gameplay with ease
- Easy ragdolls
- Great eye shader
- Realtime motion paths
### Cons
- Limiting
  - You cannot make custom face shapes
  - You cannot easily change the lighting on a map
  - You cannot easily edit a material
- Sentries suck

## Blender
Blender is an "everything" program. Everything you see can be changed one way or another, and I mean everything. And with its Python front-end, it's safe to say that Blender can actually do everything. (I made it control a robot arm!)

Blender is extremely reliant on its community. It doesn't lean towards compatibility with anything but the industry standards. Anything you want done will most likely take some addons to bridge a gap, whether it be porting, rigging, free asset libraries, tools, etc.
### Pros
- Unbelievably versatile
  - If this were a swiss army knife, it'd be one you see in a cartoon. It's ridiculous what this program can do.
- Realtime engine
- Raytracing engine
- Good keyframe graph editor
- Great for stylized art pieces
- Great media exporter
- Constantly updated
- Open source
- Geometry nodes
  - Geometry nodes can literally do anything its crazy
### Cons
- Steep learning curve
  - There is so much to learn, but don't be thrown off by how tall the mountain may seem. Slowly but surely, you'll scale it. From moving a vertex, to shading a sphere, to simulating fluids and gasses, you can master it all.
- Requires newer hardware to run

## Blender for Team Fortress 2
### Pros
- Very flexible
  - You can sculpt your own faces onto the mercenaries
  - You can change the lighting on any map
  - You can make stylized shaders with the Shader Editor

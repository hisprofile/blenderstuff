# [Installing the TF2-Trifecta](https://github.com/hisprofile/TF2-Trifecta/releases)  
The [TF2-Trifecta](https://github.com/hisprofile/TF2-Trifecta/releases) is your best friend when it comes to spawning and clothing mercs, as it handles the rigs and the ported weapons/cosmetics. Appending them yourself sure would be a pain!

After downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/hisprofile/TF2-Trifecta/releases) of the addon (Don't extract!), you'll want to head towards Blender's preferences by going to `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install...` to install it into Blender.  

Locate the newly downloaded .zip file, select it and choose `Install Add-on`. In a moment's notice, the TF2-Trifecta will be installed into Blender. Now, the only thing left is to install the assets used by `Wardrobe` and `Merc-Deployer.`

# Installing Assets
> [!NOTE]
> Requires 2GB of free space!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both methods use Google Drive to download from as I don't know of any straight forward, cheap file hosting services. If you know of one that requires no API to download from, then don't hesitate to reach out. If you are being withheld from downloading by a rate limiter, then you have my sincerest apologies. I have no alternatives.

> [!WARNING]
> These new assets are strictly for the TF2-Trifecta 3.0. I am aware the current video on the TF2-Trifecta is out of date. It is something I will get to later.  
> Make sure you are on the latest version of the TF2-Trifecta!

## Method #1
The easiest way to install the assets is by going into the `Scene Properties` and using the `Install TF2 Items` feature with `Include Rigs` enabled. Set the installation path to an empty folder and begin.

Within a short wait, the TF2-Trifecta should have automatically installed all the required cosmetics, weapons, and rig assets, allowing you to now utilize all features of the TF2-Trifecta including weapon/cosmetic spawning, cosmetic painting, and mercenary deployments.

## Method #2  
If for whatever reason you \**don't*\* choose the easy way and want to download the assets one by one, then here's the guide for that.

All that is required to do is add all of these .blend files in the immediate folder, into **ONE** folder. This is where the TF2-Trifecta will mount and scan the assets.

Open [The TF2 Items Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1JFzUvfiiBF8ukpL50ewZDct98E96oNmL) folder in Google Drive, and download the whole thing as a `.zip` archive, or download each file individually. The `.zip` download will be split, but don't be concerned. It's fairly easy to extract and it helps prevent crossing a rate limiter threshold.  

Once the `.zip` files are downloaded, move them where ever you'd like. Select all the .zip files, right click on one, and press `Extract All`. WinRAR is better at doing this, so if you experience any errors with validating the files, it may be due to how the files were extracted. Use either WinRAR or 7zip. 

With all the cosmetics and weapons downloaded, it's now time to download a [Rig-set.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1DF6S3lmqA8xtIMflWhzV242OrUnP62ws) Read the guide on rigs to choose which rig-set is right for you.  

With the cosmetics & weapons downloaded, place all of the items into a single folder.

Open Blender, and go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > TF2-Trifecta` and set your `TF2 Items Path`. Select the folder where you placed all your assets, and then click `Scan`

The scanning process will take time. If you'd like to watch the progress, make sure you have the console open beforehand.

Now add a set of rigs. Navigate to the path where you extracted the rig-set.

After Downloading and setting up The TF2 Collection & a rig-set, your installation of the TF2-Trifecta should look like this. There should be **no** mention of any missing assets.

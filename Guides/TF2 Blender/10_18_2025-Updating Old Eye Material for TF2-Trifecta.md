# How to Update Eye Materials for TF2-Trifecta Mercenaries
## Fantastic News!
After four years, the mercenary eye shader has finally been updated to be ON-PAR with SFM! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This replaces the dinky old shader that simply projected a texture onto the mesh. I have finally been able to read the original shader source code, and re-create the shader with Blender's shader nodes!

Getting this update is as simple as updating your TF2 rigs through the TF2-Trifecta. However, older projects will still use the original eye shader. Luckily, updating the shaders is no monumental task.

## Updating the Shader
After updating your TF2 rigs, your old projects should now have a text file named `source eye updater`, automatically imported via `_resources.blend`

After locating the text file, execute the script.

Then, go to the "Tool" tab, and locate the "Update Mercs Automatically" operator. Click on this operator.

Ta-da!!! Your mercenaries should now have the new eye shader.
